1. create a config file and save it to the sdcard.
	- the max no of tcp retries before sending the sms
	- the number to which to send teh sms
	- 
logic
1. if tcp config fails
	1. if tcp_failures.txt exists,
		1. -load value stored there.
		   -load value of max tcp retries from config.txt
			   -if stored value %  max no of retries == 0 
			     send sms
		   -increase stored value by one.
 
	2. else if tcp_failures.txt does not exists
		1. - send sms to a hardcoded number(the default)

2. else if it succeeds
	if tcp_config.txt exixts
		delete it and create the same file .
		write there value 0.
